# Computer Vision iOS app for Playing Card Detection
Using videos of playing cards, individual scenes are generated of two or three playing cards on top of a random background. These scenes are used to train a model in Turi Create that can then be deployed to an iOS app.

The resulting notebooks used for each step can be found in this repo or in the colab notebooks located in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oi1frt48b8Ug_YW8MSP927-hPAtUMYgX?usp=sharing). Using Google Colab, the project dependencies are all contained within the individual notebooks, so no setup should be required.

A video overview of the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ZEHn_VSixwI).
